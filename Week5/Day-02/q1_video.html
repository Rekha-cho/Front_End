<!-- Question 1
Video Fallback with Multiple Formats and Accessibility 
You are designing a responsive education website that needs to support videos across 
different browsers and assistive technologies. Write an HTML snippet that: 
● Embeds a video with MP4, WebM, and Ogg formats. 
● Displays a fallback message if the video is not supported. 
● Includes a subtitle track in English. 
● Adds a poster image before the video plays. 
● Ensures the video is muted by default and loops. 
Also explain how this implementation supports accessibility and cross-browser 
compatibility.  -->
